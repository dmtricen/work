# Air coming out of the air eliminator

If there is a lot of air coming out of the air eliminator, you have a leak!  The air has to be coming from somewhere and it’s not coming from the tank below.  Check the union and other pipes for signs of leaking.  Note it will only leak after you turn off the motor, otherwise it’s sucking air through the leak and you’ll never see it.  

# Fuel is coming out of the air eliminator

If after a few seconds the unit expels fuel out of the air eliminator, it’s likely that the float inside is damaged.

The float lifts up after the top chamber is about half full of fuel.  That opens a hole under the metal lever for the fuel to flow down and out of the first chamber.  If that plastic shaft doesn’t lift out of the hole because the float is damaged, the whole chamber fills with fuel and eventually comes out the top.
