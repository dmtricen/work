# PI & PO

Every relay box I’ve seen has a terminal that sends a signal when it detects a hook signal (signal wire) and a terminal that controls the coil on the relay (coil wire).  These allow a remote system to control its operation.  You can put a jumper between them to bypass this feature and it will operate all on its own.
