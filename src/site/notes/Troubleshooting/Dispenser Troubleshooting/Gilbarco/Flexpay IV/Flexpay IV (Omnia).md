Software update:
- There are two different software packages in the extranet that could be used for the Omnia, the standard package and the “Encore Experience”.  Call TAC to determine which should be installed at the site (we can’t tell the difference).  
- Also note there is a package called ICS.  No idea what it does.  Ask TAC if it needs installation.  
- When dropping software into the software updater, drop in the zipped version, not the extracted.
