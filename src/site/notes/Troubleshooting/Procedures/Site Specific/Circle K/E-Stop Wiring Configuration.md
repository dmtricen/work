There are a number of Circle-K with a e-stop management system installed.

I have discovered the following: 

1) Fuel Reset is necessary to pull in the relays for the fuel
2) This system apparently reacts when its source of 120v is removed.  The 120v source must be restored before you can hit the Reset button and pull in the relays again.  
3) So far, 2 of the 3 stores with this system have wired their E-Stops in a Normally Closed configuration.  This allows for the constant source of 120v to be interrupted.
