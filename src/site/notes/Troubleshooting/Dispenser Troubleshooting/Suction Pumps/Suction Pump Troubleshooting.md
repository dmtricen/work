# Question 1: is air coming out of the air eliminator?

![SuctionPump1.jpeg](/img/user/Assets/Images/SuctionPump1.jpeg)

If there is a lot of air coming out of the air eliminator, you have a leak!  The air has to be coming from somewhere and it’s not coming from the tank below.  Check the union and other pipes for signs of leaking.  Note it will only leak after you turn off the motor, otherwise it’s sucking air through the leak and you’ll never see it.
