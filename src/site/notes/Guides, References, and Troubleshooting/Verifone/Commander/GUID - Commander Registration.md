When you’re done configuring a commander, you need to register it with Verifone.  In C-Store, select Registration and observe the small box that pops up.  

Using that info, go to the Verifone site and log in.  Go to Manage > Register Product > Register.  Once there, enter the Service ID and select your site.  

Now you will have to put information into two different pages.  The first page isn’t super important, except that what you put in here will affect what fields appear on the second page where it IS important.
