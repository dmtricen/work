This 3-Phase thermal overload relay is designed for STPs using 3-phase power and have a thermal overload component that can be reset.  

The orange wire in the picture is the control wire (120v).  3 Phase power comes in through the top and leaves from the bottom to head to the STP. 

When using this, a capacitor is apparently not necessary.
