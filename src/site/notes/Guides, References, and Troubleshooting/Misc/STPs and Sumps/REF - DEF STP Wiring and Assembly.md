## Heads up

DEF, like any STP, comes in two varieties, single phase and 3 phase.  Single phase needs a capacitor, 3 phase does not.

## Wiring Tips

The wires used to connect the STP are not interchangeable (that's not strictly true with 3 phase, but avoid it).

## Installation Tips

We have run into a few extractables that were assembled wrong.  There is a pressure relief valve above the stp and a one way check valve above that.  If these are reversed, if the check valve gets stuck, pressure can't escape the STP and it dies.  

Also, before installing a new STP, put it into a bucket of water, wire it up and have someone turn it on and off really fast.  That will verify that it works before putting it into the tank.
