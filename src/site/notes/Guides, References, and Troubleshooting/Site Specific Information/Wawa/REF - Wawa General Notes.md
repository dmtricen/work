- Dispensers automatically shut down if you open either top or bottom doors.  This is by design.  It will reactivate when both doors are closed.  
- Some Wawas have a network lockdown that will shutdown all dispensers if you connect to the Omnia.  Check with network center before connecting to be sure and ask to have security disabled while you are working.  
	- Contact the Security Center by sending an email to OCC@wawa.com, note the Wawa store number, identify yourself and ask to shutdown security long enough for you to do your work.  You'll get an email back within 5 minutes or so (according to Lyle).
