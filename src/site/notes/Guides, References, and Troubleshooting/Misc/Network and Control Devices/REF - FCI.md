Data and pump communication comes here.  When installing a [[Guides, References, and Troubleshooting/Misc/Network and Control Devices/REF - BRCM2\|REF - BRCM2]], data wires (going to one of the boards) go away and ONE pair goes to the BRCM2 andIP data stops there.  Then, one pair goes from it back to the FCI on its board.

Should the current loop board lights scroll very slowly (flashing on each channel twice before moving on) this means they are not communicating.  Check the network cable.
