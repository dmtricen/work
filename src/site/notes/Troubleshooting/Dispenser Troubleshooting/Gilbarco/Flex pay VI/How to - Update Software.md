Below is the procedure to update software stored on a USB.  

1. Remove power from the dispenser
2. Plug usb into an available usb port on the back bottom of the Invenco screen
	1. There is usually only one usb port unoccupied.  
	2. Make sure you are using a usb port on the monitor and NOT the black box attached to it (the APC)

3. Plug in dispenser
4. After a minute or so, the screen will prompt you for a password.  Enter 123456
	1. The Invenco checks to see if it detects a USB inserted on startup.  That’s why it prompts for a password now.  If it doesn’t, check and ensure the USB is inserted correctly.
5. Select USB Update by touching it on the screen. 
6. Depending on the size of the update, this may take 15 seconds or 45 minutes.  Just be patient.
7. Once installation is complete, it will tell you on screen that it is safe to remove the USB.  Do so and select Confirm to have it reboot.
8. Now unplug the dispenser again and perform the same steps on the opposite side.  Each side needs to update individually.  
9. After around 10 minutes of the unit being online, it will perform a final installation.  Until this time, you may not see any installation activity.  When you see the Installation Results screen, it will inform you as to whether it was successful or not.  Select the Installed OK button to let it restart one final time.
