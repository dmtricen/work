# STP Hook Signal
The 4 terminal connector at the bottom puts out STP Hook signals.  It goes from low grade to high grade and then to any + grade (usually RUL, PUL, and Non-Eth and DSL).  Any terminal that is not programmed to trigger for a grade will always put out 89-90 volts.  If the micro relay is missing it will put out around 5 volts while hose is not active.  

Always put one meter lead on the white neutral on the power plug THEN put a lead on the terminal you want to test.
