### Weird Situation 1
- If you make a dispenser update on the Passport Server and suddenly all the dispensers go down (In my case, the error on screen was "No card pay now.  Begin fueling")
	- Restart the EDH.  Actually, if ANYTHING weird happens with Passport, restart the EDH.  It has some weird quirks that can only be fixed by restarting.
