If this occurs, take a look at the PIP.  Does it have red lights?

This is a bad sign.  Finally, look at the UPM.  Are there lights on the left side?

If there are no lights or the top light is out then the UPM is bad and needs to be replaced.  You can also check the PIP by unplugging the usb from the UPM and plug it into a laptop that is on.  If the red lights on the PIP go out, it is good.
