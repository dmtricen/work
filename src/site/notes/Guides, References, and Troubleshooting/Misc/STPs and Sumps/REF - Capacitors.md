Capacitors are used for Single Phase STPs.  The only time they will not be needed is when
1. it's a three phase motor
2. its a variable speed STP and uses a MagVFC or similar

In most cases the capacitor is stored in the motor head in the sump.  Otherwise, it'll be located in an STP control box with all the other control equipment.
