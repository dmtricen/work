The Blue/ Yellow pair is normally CRIND and the Red/Yellow is pump.  With CRIND over IP and a DCM3, wire the twisted pair (likely the wires they used for CRIND) to the Yellow/Yellow pair going to the DCM3 and ignore the Blue/Yellow coming from the Omnia Board.  

Ultimately it goes to the BRCM2 for data splitting.
