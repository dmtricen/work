- Dispensers automatically shut down if you open either top or bottom doors.  This is by design.  It will reactivate when both doors are closed.  
- Some Wawas have a network lockdown that will shutdown all dispensers if you connect to the Omnia.  Check with network center before connecting to be sure and ask to have security disabled while you are working.
