## CRIND BIOS

When a Flexpay IV dispenser can’t communicate with the fuel controller (be it commander, passport, dex, etc.) it will stop loading on the screen showing “crind bios”.  I haven’t found any way to fix this without restarting the fuel controller.  This usually involves a call to 7-11, verifone, or Gilbarco.  Or, you could manually restart it.
